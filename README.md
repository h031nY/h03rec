# h03rec
h03recon is created to assist bug hunters and red teamers in simplifying their work. It provides an automated solution for gathering subdomains, gathering related target domains, scanning ports, resolving active subdomains, discovering real IPs behind CDNs, crawling on all subdomains, and streamlining the reconnaissance process. With the script, researchers can easily collect subdomains associated with a target, check open ports on the target's network, retrieve banners from services running on those ports, and streamline the overall process of gathering valuable information for further analysis and investigation.
